# Firebase Studio ðŸ‘‹

This is a Next.js starter project for Firebase Studio, designed to provide a robust starting point for building modern web applications with AI-powered features.

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack application built with Next.js and Firebase. It leverages Google's Genkit for integrating AI capabilities and uses `shadcn/ui` for a clean, modern user interface. The starter includes examples of AI flows, UI components, and services for interacting with external APIs like GitHub.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure, with some additional directories for organizing the code:

- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - **`ai/`**: Holds all the AI-related logic, built with the Genkit framework.
    - **`flows/`**: Defines the specific AI flows (e.g., `assistant-flow.ts`).
  - **`app/`**: The core Next.js application directory, using the App Router.
  - **`components/`**: Contains reusable React components.
    - **`ui/`**: UI components built with `shadcn/ui`.
  - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for shared component logic.
  - **`lib/`**: Utility functions and helper scripts.
  - **`services/`**: Modules for interacting with external APIs and services (e.g., `github.ts`).
